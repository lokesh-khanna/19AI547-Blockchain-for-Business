# Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.

# Algorithm:
Step 1:
The manufacturer records product creation details on-chain.

Step 2:
The product moves through different supply chain checkpoints.

Step 3:
The ownership of the product can be transferred securely.

Step 4:
Buyers can verify the product’s authenticity.

contract LuxurySupplyChain {
    struct Product {
        string name;
        address currentOwner;
        bool verified;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;

    event ProductRegistered(uint256 productId, string name);
    event OwnershipTransferred(uint256 productId, address newOwner);

    function registerProduct(uint256 productId, string memory name) public {
        require(products[productId].currentOwner == address(0), "Product already registered");
        products[productId] = Product(name, msg.sender, true);
        emit ProductRegistered(productId, name);
    }

    function transferOwnership(uint256 productId, address newOwner) public {
        require(products[productId].currentOwner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        products[productId].currentOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(productId, newOwner);
    }

    function verifyProduct(uint256 productId) public view returns (string memory, address, bool) {
        Product memory p = products[productId];
        return (p.name, p.currentOwner, p.verified);
    }
}

# Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a Rolex watch) is registered on-chain.

Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.

Buyers can check the authenticity before purchasing.
